## Installation Requirements

We have decided to move to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true). This means you only need a Google account and you're good to go. Google Colab is especially useful for image classification, since you can use a GPU for free on Google Colab to speed up the training process. See [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-tensorflow-keras-pytorch.html) on how to enable a GPU in Google Colab - it's really simple.
